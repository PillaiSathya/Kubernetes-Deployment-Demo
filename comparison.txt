ðŸ”„ Kubernetes Service Types â€“ Comparison Chart

Service Type	Purpose	Accessible From	Use Case
ClusterIP	Default; gives a service IP	Inside the cluster only	Internal communication (e.g., backend â†” database)
NodePort	Exposes service via a port on each node	External (host IP:port)	Local/dev setups, exposing pods outside the cluster
LoadBalancer	Integrates with cloud provider LB	External (auto IP)	Production on cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
ExternalName	Maps to external DNS name	Redirects to external	Access external services (e.g., mysql.example.com)
Headless	No cluster IP; returns pod IPs directly	Inside cluster	Stateful sets, direct pod discovery
ðŸ’¡ In your local setup (Docker Desktop):

Use NodePort to access services from the browser.

Use ClusterIP for internal pod communication.

Use LoadBalancer only as a simulation (since it maps to localhost).
